/*
	Question : In many introductory computer programming classes, the first program that students learn to write just prints 
	“Hello, world!” It is used as a first assignment because it is a simple program that produces output. 
	The program dates back to at least 1974, when Brian Kernighan used it as an example in a C programming tutorial. 
	Its popularity has grown since then. 
	Louisiana Tech University's ACM chapter has a Hello World project that has collected versions of this program in almost 200 different computer languages.

	While “Hello, World!” is a nice and simple first program, it does have one drawback. 
	The program says hello to the world, but the world does not respond! 
	This one-sided conversation is starting to become awkward after more than 35 years. 
	For this problem, write a program that returns greetings from the world to the program.

	input			 
	
	output
	The world says hello!
	
	Solution : 1. 단순 출력
